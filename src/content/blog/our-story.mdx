## From Frustration to a Product

Hiring niche tech talent in Europe is hard. Agencies charge enormous fees, take weeks to deliver a handful of CVs, and rarely understand the role beyond a keyword checklist. We'd been on both sides of that process — as hiring managers and as candidates — and we knew there had to be a better way.

That frustration became the seed for HireAssist by CubeA.

## The Problem We Saw

Traditional recruitment hasn't changed much in twenty years. A human recruiter searches a database, sends a few LinkedIn messages, and forwards whatever lands in their inbox. The process is slow, opaque, and expensive — often 15–25 % of first-year salary per hire.

Meanwhile, modern AI can parse a CV in milliseconds, rank hundreds of candidates against a job spec, and flag the top 10 % for human review. The tech exists. It just hadn't been packaged in a way that was affordable and trustworthy for mid-sized European companies.

## What We Built

HireAssist is a hybrid: AI does the heavy lifting on sourcing and ranking, humans do the judgment calls on culture fit, communication style, and real-world experience. The result is a shortlist that's both fast and genuinely good — not just a stack of keyword-matched PDFs.

We keep the pricing simple too. No retainers, no hidden fees. You pay when we deliver a hire.

## What's Next

We're currently in a warm-up phase, working with a small group of pilot clients in the Netherlands and Germany. If you're hiring for a niche role and want to see what we can do, [get in touch](/# contact).

More updates coming soon.
